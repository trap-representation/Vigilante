Vigilante depends on some implementation-specific behavior to work and is NOT strictly conforming to the ISO/IEC 9899:2011 specification. However, the details it assumes about implementations hold true for most C implementations you'll find, so if you're translating it with something like Clang, GCC, or TCC, you most likely have nothing to worry about.
Currently, Vigilante only works on Linux and similar environments that can emulate its behavior. Check the source for the Linux-specific headers it includes.
Before you translate Vigilante, make the necessary changes to vigilante/src/vconfig.h according to your implementation.

WTDF is meant to be translated as a library. Use it with your own program to generate TDF files.
